**2. LA Crime Dataset and its contents**
For this project, we used the "Crime Data from 2020 to present" dataset published by the city of Los Angeles (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present). 

This dataset reflects incidents of crime in the City of Los Angeles dating from 2020 to present with every single crime occurrence that was reported to and documented by the Los Angeles Police Department.

The dataset includes: 
- DATE/TIME columns about the crime including the date reported, date of occurrence, and time occurred
- STRING columns including area name, crime code description, victim age, victim sex, victim descent
- latitude, and longitude.

**3. Questions Highlighting Interesting Phenomenom**

- Q#1: What is rate of violent crime based on location during Covid19 in Los Angeles?
  
    Areas with higher violent crime during Covid 19 would be an important variable because it can help the city of Los Angeles allocate resources effectively as well as identify any worrying trends of violent crime that is targeting a certain demographic. 

    In addition, high crime areas in general have a negative impact on society socially because it directly impacts the safety of individuals who live, work, and visit that area. This can also keep individuals who live there in a cycle of poverty, unemployment, and lack of educational opportunities due to less funding from property tax for public infrastructure and decreased economic investment.

    In conclusion, aggregating data of violent crime within locations in Los Angeles as a whole can help government entities make informed decisions on policies to decrease the crime rate and increase productivity and safety for all its citizens.
