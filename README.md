**2. LA Crime Dataset and its contents**
For this project, we used the "Crime Data from 2020 to present" dataset published by the city of Los Angeles (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present). 

This dataset reflects incidents of crime in the City of Los Angeles dating from 2020 to present with every single crime occurrence that was reported to and documented by the Los Angeles Police Department.

The dataset includes: 
- DATE/TIME columns about the crime including the date reported, date of occurrence, and time occurred
- STRING columns including area name, crime code description, victim age, victim sex, victim descent
- DECIMAL columns including latitude and longitude.

**3. Questions Highlighting Interesting Phenomenom**

- Q#1: Is the rate of violent crime based on location during COVID 19 significant economically and/or socially?

  Importance:
    Areas with higher violent crime during Covid 19 would be an important variable because it can help the city of Los Angeles allocate resources effectively as well as identify any worrying trends of violent crime that is targeting a certain demographic. 

    In addition, high crime areas in general have a negative impact on society socially because it directly impacts the safety of individuals who live, work, and visit that area. This can also keep individuals who live there in a cycle of poverty, unemployment, and lack of educational opportunities due to less funding from property tax for public infrastructure and decreased economic investment.

    In conclusion, aggregating data of violent crime within locations in Los Angeles as a whole can help government entities make informed decisions on policies to decrease the crime rate and increase productivity and safety for all its citizens.

- Q#2: What is the rate of violent crimes towards Asians in the most extreme violent crime rate location, median and least extreme violent crime location?

  Importance:
  Violent crime data towards Asians is important during Covid 19 because there was a surge of Anti-Asian hate and incidents. Tracking data on violent crimes towards Asians in the most extreme, median and least extreme violent crime rate locations is especially important because it can identify more specific details of when the rise of violent crime towards Asians occurred and what specific crimes are used to target Asian victims.

Furthermore, studying the crime data on these three locations with varying crime rates can also give policymakers of Los Angeles a better understanding of how big of a scope this issue is as well as how to reduce the amount of Asian violent crime.

**4. Manipulations Applied to Data Set**

In order to calculate the rate of violent crimes, our team had to change one of our dimensions into a measure (quantitative). We first found the count of every violent crime in the city of Los Angeles by location. We then performed a quick table calculation on our measure to find the rate or precentage of crimes in relation to the total number of crimes per location.

**5. Analysis and Results:**

Question 1:

In our analysis, our group used a bar chart to depict the economical and social significance of the rate of violent crime based on location. According to the chart, “Pacific” has the highest rate of violent crimes while “Southeast” has the lowest. Based on our results, we can conclude that the Los Angeles government needs to prioritize their efforts for the area “Pacific” and spend less time in the “Southeast” area.

Question 2:

In order to depict the rate of violence crimes towards Asians in the most/least extreme areas, our group used a barchart to find these areas and then a line graph to key in on these certain areas. Looking at the barchart, we found out that the areas with the most/least extreme rates of violent crime towards Asians were “Olympic” and “Southeast”. Despite Olympic being in the middle of the pack when it came to rates of violent crimes in Los Angeles, we discovered that they are the highest among areas when it came to violent crimes towards Asians.

Taking a look at the line graph, we can identify that during the years 2020 - 2021 (COVID 19), these violent crimes towards Asians were peaking. Likewise, the areas “Northeast” as well as “Southeast” show small peaks during these COVID 19 years. This information provides important insight when it comes to preventing and correcting violent crimes towards Asians in the city of Los Angeles.
